          Welcome to our Plant Classification and Counting Project! In this project, we aim to provide an efficient solution for classifying and counting plants using the YOLO v8 object detection algorithm. This technology stack utilizes the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) combined with TypeScript for enhanced code quality and Electron to create a desktop application with a user-friendly interface.
